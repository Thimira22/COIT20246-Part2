# Project Reflection

## Introduction

This section reflects on the overall performance of our group project, focusing on the contributions of **Student A (Deven Roka)** and **Student B (Boraluwage Thimira Nawanjana)**. It includes an analysis of the **tasks** completed, the **Git commit history**, and provides a reflection on what worked well and the challenges faced during the project. This reflection will also propose **best practices** for future group projects to ensure effective teamwork and collaboration.

## 1. Screenshot Showing Commits of All Team Members

Below is the **Git commit history** showing the contributions made by both team members:

- **Student A (Deven)**: 15 commits.
- **Student B (Thimira)**: 9 commits.

## 2. Task Division

The tasks for the project were divided between **Student A (Deven)** and **Student B (Thimira)** as follows:

| **Task**                             | **Assigned to**            | **Description** |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Cloud Services Evaluation (AWS vs Azure) | **Student A (Deven)**     | Researching cloud services, including cost analysis for AWS and Azure. |
| Data Protection Regulations Review   | **Student B (Thimira)**   | Reviewing relevant data protection laws (GDPR, APPs) and their implications. |
| Security Risks and Recommendations   | **Student A (Deven)**     | Identifying security risks for Truelec and suggesting security measures. |
| Integration with Microsoft Products   | **Student B (Thimira)**   | Analyzing Azureâ€™s integration with Microsoft products. |
| Writing the Final Report (Markdown)  | **Both**                   | Writing and compiling the final report on AWS vs Azure for the infrastructure. |

The division of tasks ensured that both students had **equal responsibility**, with each focusing on their strengths, such as **cloud services evaluation** (Deven) and **data protection regulations** (Thimira).

## 3. Git Commit Analysis

### **Comparison of Commits with Tasks Performed**

| **Student**         | **Number of Commits** | **Tasks Performed**                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Student A (Deven)**| 15 commits            | Primary responsibility for the **AWS cloud services evaluation**, **security risks**, and **final report writing**. |
| **Student B (Thimira)**| 9 commits             | Focused on **Azure cloud services**, **data protection regulations**, and contributing to the **final report**. |

### **Analysis**:
- **Student A (Deven)** had more commits as they were mainly responsible for detailed research and analysis of **AWS** services, which required frequent updates and refinement of the markdown document.
- **Student B (Thimira)** made fewer commits but still contributed significantly to the **Azure analysis** and **data protection regulations** review. The lower number of commits is aligned with their focus on regulatory frameworks, which required less frequent updates.

## 4. Git Commits Over Time

Here is the analysis of when both students were active during the project term:

- **Student A (Deven)**: Actively committed during all weeks (Week 1 to Week 8).
- **Student B (Thimira)**: Committed consistently in **Weeks 1 to 6** but had **reduced activity** in **Week 7**. Despite fewer commits in Week 7, overall contribution was on par with **Student A** in terms of completed tasks.

### **Commit Frequency**:
- Both students contributed regularly, ensuring consistent progress throughout the term.
- Week 7 saw a slowdown in activity, but by Week 8, both students were actively finalizing the documentation and estimates.

## 5. Reflection on Group Work

### **What Worked Well**:
- **Clear Communication**: Weekly meetings helped ensure that both team members were aligned on project goals and tasks. We discussed the project regularly on Slack, ensuring efficient coordination and task delegation.
- **Task Distribution**: By dividing the work based on strengths, both students focused on different aspects of the project, making it easier to manage and complete. Deven handled the **cloud services evaluation**, while Thimira focused on **data privacy and security**.

### **Challenges Encountered**:
- **Task Alignment**: There were a few occasions when the division of tasks was unclear, especially when researching and comparing cloud services. We had to frequently sync to ensure both AWS and Azure estimates were consistent and complete.
- **Git Merge Conflicts**: There were occasional **merge conflicts** while editing the **final report markdown**. These were resolved by clearly defining sections for each student in the document before edits.

## 6. Techniques for Future Group Projects

### **Recommended Techniques**:
1. **Regular Check-ins**:
   - **Problem Solved**: Ensures all team members are on the same page and prevents work from diverging. 
   - **Implementation**: In future group projects, we will schedule **mid-week check-ins** to discuss progress and align on next steps.

2. **Task Assignment and Deadlines**:
   - **Problem Solved**: Helps with clear accountability and task prioritization.
   - **Implementation**: Using a tool like **Trello** or **Google Sheets**, we will assign deadlines to each task and keep track of progress throughout the project.

3. **Version Control Best Practices**:
   - **Problem Solved**: Minimizes merge conflicts and ensures efficient collaboration.
   - **Implementation**: We will establish **branching protocols** for collaborative work and ensure that any major edits are made in separate branches and merged only after review.

4. **Clear Documentation**:
   - **Problem Solved**: Prevents misunderstandings and keeps everyone informed.
   - **Implementation**: For future projects, we will maintain a **shared document** (Google Docs or GitHub Wiki) to track decisions, sources, and changes made to the project over time.
